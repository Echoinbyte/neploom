# üöÄ Introducing NepLoom ‚Äî Curiosity Unleashed.

NepLoom is not just a platform ‚Äî it's a movement.
A place where curiosity begins, and spreads.

In a world full of information overload and boring PDFs, NepLoom reimagines how we learn, share, and grow.

## üìö What is NepLoom?
NepLoom is an Ed-tech social blogging platform where creators, called **NepLers**, craft and post blogs known as **Looms**. But these aren‚Äôt just regular blogs ‚Äî they‚Äôre infused with gamified experiences and interactive learning tools.

From in-blog games like:
-   Blast üß®
-   Match üß©
-   Blocks üß±
-   Quiz ‚ùì
-   Flashcards üÉè

To profile gamification like:
-   Streaks üî•
-   LoomCoins üí∞

Learning becomes addictive ‚Äî in a good way.

## üß† Smarter, Not Harder
NepLoom is built for active learning and retention. Each Loom can include:
-   Text-to-Speech for auditory learners üó£Ô∏è
-   Mindmaps and Notes for structured thinking üß†
-   AI-generated summaries to save time ‚è±Ô∏è
-   One-click translation to break language barriers üåê
-   A ‚ÄúTeach‚Äù mode so anyone can become a mentor üßë‚Äçüè´

It's learning made personal and powerful.

## üíª More Than Just Blogs
NepLoom supports:
-   Articles üìÑ
-   Microblogs (Quicks) ‚ö°
-   Documentation Sharing üìö

With custom code support, NepLoom also doubles as a developer-friendly SaaS tool. Creators can:
-   Customize their blog (Loom) design üé®
-   Customize profile layouts üñºÔ∏è
-   Embed NepLoom content on personal sites using APIs üîó
-   Share content as public, private, or unlisted üîí

It's your space. Your rules.

## üí∏ Monetization & Rewards
NepLoom respects creators and readers alike.
There are two types of **Loomers**:
-   **Space Loomers**: Earn by watching ads üì∫
-   **Time Loomers**: Skip ads, save time ‚è≥

Ad revenue is split transparently:
NepLoom / NepLer / Loomer ‚Üí 40% / 40% / 20%

Creators (**NepLers**) can:
-   Add promotional links üì¢
-   Run paid promotions for others ü§ù
-   Earn badges for verified content ‚úÖ

## üß™ What‚Äôs Next?
We‚Äôre building the future.
Soon, you‚Äôll be able to:
-   Upload images üñºÔ∏è
-   Ask AI questions based on that content ü§ñüí¨

Imagine asking questions to a blog as if it were a person. That‚Äôs where we‚Äôre going.

## üåç Our Vision
NepLoom isn‚Äôt just another blogging platform.
It‚Äôs a dream ‚Äî
of making education free, fun, and for everyone.

Let‚Äôs make curiosity contagious.
Let‚Äôs build the future of learning ‚Äî together.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v18.x or later recommended)
-   npm or yarn
-   Git

### Cloning the Project

1.  **Fork the repository** (Optional, but recommended if you plan to contribute):
    Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the main repository page on GitHub.

2.  **Clone your forked repository** (or the original repository if you are not contributing directly):
    Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username if you forked. Replace `Echoinbyte/neploom` with the actual path to the main repository if needed.
    ```bash
    # If you forked the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/neploom.git
    
    # Or, to clone the original repository directly:
    # git clone https://github.com/Echoinbyte/neploom.git
    
    cd neploom
    ```

### Installation

Install the project dependencies using npm or yarn:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### Running the Development Server

Start the Next.js development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (or the port indicated in your terminal) with your browser to see the result.

### Building for Production

To create a production-ready build:
```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

### Running in Production Mode

To start the server in production mode after building (this usually requires a hosting platform or a Node.js server environment):
```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions are what make the open-source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.

### Pull Request (PR) Process

1.  **Ensure your code lints and passes tests.** (Details on running linters/tests should be added here if applicable).
2.  **Update the README.md** with details of any changes to the interface, new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations, or container parameters if applicable.
3.  **Keep your PR focused.** Make sure your PR addresses only one issue or feature. Create separate PRs for unrelated changes.
4.  **Write clear commit messages.** Follow conventional commit message standards if the project uses them.
5.  **Request reviews.** Once your PR is ready, request a review from project maintainers or other contributors.

### Setting up your local environment for contributing:

1.  **Fork the project** (if you haven't already).
2.  **Clone your fork** to your local machine.
3.  **Create a new branch** for your feature or bug fix. It's good practice to name your branch descriptively (e.g., `feature/add-image-upload` or `fix/login-bug`).
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature
    # or for a fix
    # git checkout -b fix/SomeBug
    ```
4.  **Make your changes.** Implement your feature or fix the bug.
5.  **Commit your changes.** Use clear and descriptive commit messages.
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m 'feat: Add some AmazingFeature'
    # or for a fix
    # git commit -m 'fix: Resolve SomeBug'
    ```
6.  **Push your changes** to your forked repository on GitHub.
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/AmazingFeature
    ```
7.  **Open a Pull Request (PR).** Go to the original NepLoom repository on GitHub. You should see a prompt to create a PR from your recently pushed branch. Fill out the PR template with a clear description of your changes.

### Staying Up-to-Date with the Main Project

To keep your local fork and branches up-to-date with the main NepLoom repository (often referred to as `upstream`):

1.  **Configure an `upstream` remote** (you only need to do this once):
    ```bash
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/Echoinbyte/neploom.git 
    # Replace with the actual URL of the main NepLoom repository
    ```
2.  **Fetch changes from `upstream`**:
    ```bash
    git fetch upstream
    ```
3.  **Merge changes into your local `main` (or `master`) branch**:
    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git merge upstream/main
    ```
4.  **Update your feature branch** (optional, but good practice before pushing or creating a PR):
    ```bash
    git checkout feature/AmazingFeature
    git rebase main # or git merge main
    ```

### Coding Standards

-   Follow ESLint rules (see `eslint.config.mjs`).
-   Write clear, maintainable code.
-   ...

## ü§ù Contributors

This project is a unique collaboration between human ingenuity and artificial intelligence.

*   **Sambhav Aryal (Echoinbyte)**: Lead Developer, Project Visionary, Core Architect, and Resource collaborator.
*   **AI**: My partner in creation. The AI has been instrumental in:
    *   **Copywriting**: Generating and refining the text you're reading in this `README.md`, `JOURNEY.md` and other documents.
    *   **Asset Generation**: Creating some of the initial visual assets for the project.

We believe this human-AI partnership represents the future of creative and technical work.
