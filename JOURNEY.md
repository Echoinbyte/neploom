## NepLoom Project Journal

### 17th June, 2025

The journey began today. I learned about the Summer Hack Club event and spent the day exploring ideas. The concept for NepLoom was bornâ€”a platform to revolutionize global education by making it free, engaging, and accessible to everyone. The vision is to create a space where learning isn't a chore but an adventure.

The idea is now taking shape. I started coding today, setting up the basic project structure. The initial focus was on the core architecture, including the `usePipeline` hook, which will be crucial for our interactive features. I also began sketching out the landing page in Figma, aiming for a design that is both beautiful and intuitive.

Woke up this morning with a clear goal: complete the landing page and implement the authentication system. These are the gateways to the NepLoom experience, and getting them right is essential. The plan is to create a seamless and secure entry point for our future users. The day is young, and the motivation is high. Let's get to it.
